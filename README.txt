README

This repository contains the code for simulations of the effective population size of sex chromosomes in a UV system.

In "R_Code", there are two versions of code. The main version is called "Moss_NE_simulation.R". In this code, each female randomly selects a mate.

There is an alternative version called "Moss_NE_males_first" in which males mate in a random order and each male has the opportunity to mate with all adjacent females before the next male has an opportunity to mate. This increases the variation in reproductive success among males.
